def BivariateScatterPlots(dataset):
    """
    Generates bivariate scatterplots to visually inspect relationships between pairs of numerical predictor variables
    in machine learning classification tasks.

    ### Purpose

    This function is intended for visual inspection and monitoring of relationships between pairs of numerical
    variables in a machine learning model targeting classification tasks. It helps in understanding how predictor
    variables (features) interact with each other, which can inform feature selection, model-building strategies, and
    identify potential biases or irregularities in the data.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The function creates scatter plots for each pair of numerical features in the dataset. It first filters out
    non-numerical and binary features, ensuring the plots focus on meaningful numerical relationships. The resulting
    scatterplots are color-coded uniformly to avoid visual distraction, and the function returns a tuple of Plotly
    figure objects, each representing a scatter plot for a pair of features.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - Visual patterns suggesting non-linear relationships, multicollinearity, clustering, or outlier points in the
    scatter plots.
    - Such issues could affect the assumptions and performance of certain models, especially those assuming linearity,
    like logistic regression.

    ### Strengths

    - Scatterplots provide an intuitive and visual tool to explore relationships between two variables.
    - They are useful for identifying outliers, variable associations, and trends, including non-linear patterns.
    - Supports visualization of binary or multi-class classification datasets, focusing on numerical features.

    ### Limitations

    - Scatterplots are limited to bivariate analysis, showing relationships between only two variables at a time.
    - Not ideal for very large datasets where overlapping points can reduce the clarity of the visualization.
    - Scatterplots are exploratory tools and do not provide quantitative measures of model quality or performance.
    - Interpretation is subjective and relies on the domain knowledge and judgment of the viewer.
