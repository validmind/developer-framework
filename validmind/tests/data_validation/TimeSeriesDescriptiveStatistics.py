def TimeSeriesDescriptiveStatistics(dataset):
    """
    Evaluates the descriptive statistics of a time series dataset to identify trends, patterns, and data quality issues.

    ### Purpose

    The purpose of the TimeSeriesDescriptiveStatistics function is to analyze an individual time series by providing a
    summary of key descriptive statistics. This analysis helps in understanding trends, patterns, and data quality
    issues within the time series dataset.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The function extracts the time series data and provides a summary of key descriptive statistics. The dataset is
    expected to have a datetime index, and the function will check this and raise an error if the index is not in a
    datetime format. For each variable (column) in the dataset, appropriate statistics, including start date, end date,
    min, mean, max, skewness, kurtosis, and count, are calculated.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - If the index of the dataset is not in datetime format, it could lead to errors in time-series analysis.
    - Inconsistent or missing data within the dataset might affect the analysis of trends and patterns.

    ### Strengths

    - Provides a comprehensive summary of key descriptive statistics for each variable.
    - Helps identify data quality issues and understand the distribution of the data.

    ### Limitations

    - Assumes the dataset is provided as a DataFrameDataset object with a .df attribute to access the pandas DataFrame.
    - Only analyzes datasets with a datetime index and will raise an error for other types of indices.
    - Does not handle large datasets efficiently, and performance may degrade with very large datasets.
