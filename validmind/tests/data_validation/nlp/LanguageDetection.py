    Assesses the diversity of languages in a textual dataset by detecting and visualizing the distribution of languages.

    ### Purpose

    The Language Detection test aims to identify and visualize the distribution of languages present within a textual
    dataset. This test helps in understanding the diversity of languages in the data, which is crucial for developing
    and validating multilingual models.

    ### Test Mechanism

    This test operates by:

    - Checking if the dataset has a specified text column.
    - Using a language detection library to determine the language of each text entry in the dataset.
    - Generating a histogram plot of the language distribution, with language codes on the x-axis and their frequencies
    on the y-axis.

    If the text column is not specified, a ValueError is raised to ensure proper dataset configuration.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - A high proportion of entries returning "Unknown" language codes.
    - Detection of unexpectedly diverse or incorrect language codes, indicating potential data quality issues.
    - Significant imbalance in language distribution, which might indicate potential biases in the dataset.

    ### Strengths

    - Provides a visual representation of language diversity within the dataset.
    - Helps identify data quality issues related to incorrect or unknown language detection.
    - Useful for ensuring that multilingual models have adequate and appropriate representation from various languages.

    ### Limitations

    - Dependency on the accuracy of the language detection library, which may not be perfect.
    - Languages with similar structures or limited text length may be incorrectly classified.
    - The test returns "Unknown" for entries where language detection fails, which might mask underlying issues with
    certain languages or text formats.
