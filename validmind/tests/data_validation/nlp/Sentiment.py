def Sentiment(dataset):
    """
    Analyzes the sentiment of text data within a dataset using the VADER sentiment analysis tool.

    ### Purpose

    The Sentiment test evaluates the overall sentiment of text data within a dataset. By analyzing sentiment scores, it
    aims to ensure that the model is interpreting text data accurately and is not biased towards a particular sentiment.

    ### Test Mechanism

    This test uses the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) SentimentIntensityAnalyzer. It processes
    each text entry in a specified column of the dataset to calculate the compound sentiment score, which represents
    the overall sentiment polarity. The distribution of these sentiment scores is then visualized using a KDE (Kernel
    Density Estimation) plot, highlighting any skewness or concentration in sentiment.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - Extreme polarity in sentiment scores, indicating potential bias.
    - Unusual concentration of sentiment scores in a specific range.
    - Significant deviation from expected sentiment distribution for the given text data.

    ### Strengths

    - Provides a clear visual representation of sentiment distribution.
    - Uses a well-established sentiment analysis tool (VADER).
    - Can handle a wide range of text data, making it flexible for various applications.

    ### Limitations

    - May not capture nuanced or context-specific sentiments.
    - Relies heavily on the accuracy of the VADER sentiment analysis tool.
    - Visualization alone may not provide comprehensive insights into underlying causes of sentiment distribution.
