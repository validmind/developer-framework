def ChiSquaredFeaturesTable(dataset, p_threshold=0.05):

    Assesses the statistical association between categorical features and a target variable using the Chi-Squared test.

    ### Purpose

    The `ChiSquaredFeaturesTable` function is designed to evaluate the relationship between categorical features and a
    target variable in a dataset. It performs a Chi-Squared test of independence for each categorical feature to
    determine whether a statistically significant association exists with the target variable. This is particularly
    useful in Model Risk Management for understanding the relevance of features and identifying potential biases in a
    classification model.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The function creates a contingency table for each categorical feature and the target variable, then applies the
    Chi-Squared test to compute the Chi-squared statistic and the p-value. The results for each feature include the
    variable name, Chi-squared statistic, p-value, p-value threshold, and a pass/fail status based on whether the
    p-value is below the specified threshold. The output is a DataFrame summarizing these results, sorted by p-value to
    highlight the most statistically significant associations.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - High p-values (greater than the set threshold) indicate a lack of significant association between a feature and
    the target variable, resulting in a 'Fail' status.
    - Features with a 'Fail' status might not be relevant for the model, which could negatively impact model
    performance.

    ### Strengths

    - Provides a clear, statistical assessment of the relationship between categorical features and the target variable.
    - Produces an easily interpretable summary with a 'Pass/Fail' outcome for each feature, helping in feature
    selection.
    - The p-value threshold is adjustable, allowing for flexibility in statistical rigor.

    ### Limitations

    - Assumes the dataset is tabular and consists of categorical variables, which may not be suitable for all datasets.
    - The test is designed for classification tasks and is not applicable to regression problems.
    - As with all hypothesis tests, the Chi-Squared test can only detect associations, not causal relationships.
    - The choice of p-value threshold can affect the interpretation of feature relevance, and different thresholds may
    lead to different conclusions.
