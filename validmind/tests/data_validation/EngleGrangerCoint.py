class EngleGrangerCoint(Metric):
    """
    Assesses the degree of co-movement between pairs of time series data using the Engle-Granger cointegration test.

    ### Purpose

    The intent of this Engle-Granger cointegration test is to explore and quantify the degree of co-movement between
    pairs of time series variables in a dataset. This is particularly useful in enhancing the accuracy of predictive
    regressions whenever the underlying variables are co-integrated, i.e., they move together over time.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The test first drops any non-applicable values from the input dataset and then iterates over each pair of variables
    to apply the Engle-Granger cointegration test. The test generates a 'p' value, which is then compared against a
    pre-specified threshold (0.05 by default). The pair is labeled as 'Cointegrated' if the 'p' value is less than or
    equal to the threshold or 'Not cointegrated' otherwise. A summary table is returned by the metric showing
    cointegration results for each variable pair.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - A significant number of hypothesized cointegrated variables do not pass the test.
    - A considerable number of 'p' values are close to the threshold, indicating minor data fluctuations can switch the
    decision between 'Cointegrated' and 'Not cointegrated'.

    ### Strengths

    - Provides an effective way to analyze relationships between time series, particularly in contexts where it's
    essential to check if variables move together in a statistically significant manner.
    - Useful in various domains, especially finance or economics, where predictive models often hinge on understanding
    how different variables move together over time.

    ### Limitations

    - Assumes that the time series are integrated of the same order, which isn't always true in multivariate time
    series datasets.
    - The presence of non-stationary characteristics in the series or structural breaks can result in falsely positive
    or negative cointegration results.
    - May not perform well for small sample sizes due to lack of statistical power and should be supplemented with
    other predictive indicators for a more robust model evaluation.
