@dataclass
class Robustness(ThresholdTest, AIPoweredTest):
    """
    Assesses the robustness of prompts provided to a Large Language Model under varying conditions and contexts.

    **Purpose:**
    The Robustness test is meant to evaluate the resilience and reliability of prompts provided to a Language Learning
    Model (LLM). The aim of this test is to guarantee that the prompts consistently generate accurate and the expected
    outputs, despite being in diverse or challenging scenarios.

    **Test Mechanism:**
    The Robustness test appraises prompts under various conditions, alterations, and contexts to ascertain their
    stability in producing consistent responses from the LLM. Factors evaluated range from different phrasings,
    inclusion of potential distracting elements, and various input complexities. By default, the test generates 10
    inputs for a prompt but can be adjusted according to test parameters.

    **Signs of High Risk:**

    - If the output from the tests diverges extensively from the expected results, this indicates high risk.
    - When the prompt doesn't give a consistent performance across various tests.
    - A high risk is indicated when the prompt is susceptible to breaking, especially when the output is expected to be
    of a specific type.

    **Strengths:**

    - The robustness test helps to ensure stable performance of the LLM prompts and lowers the chances of generating
    unexpected or off-target outputs.
    - This test is vital for applications where predictability and reliability of the LLM’s output are crucial.

    **Limitations:**

    - Currently, the test only supports single-variable prompts, which restricts its application to more complex models.
    - When there are too many target classes (over 10), the test is skipped, which can leave potential vulnerabilities
    unchecked in complex multi-class models.
    - The test may not account for all potential conditions or alterations that could show up in practical use
    scenarios.

You are a prompt evaluation researcher AI who is tasked with testing the robustness of LLM prompts.

Consider the following guidelines:
```
LLM prompts are used to guide a model to generate specific outputs or solve specific tasks. These prompts can be more or less robust, meaning that they can be more or less susceptible to breaking especially when the output needs to be a specific type.
A robust prompt ensures consistent performance and reduces the likelihood of unexpected or off-tangent outputs. This consistency is vital for applications where predictability and reliability of the LLM's response are paramount.
```

Consider the user-submitted prompt template and generate an input for the variable in the template (denoted by brackets) that tests the robustness of the prompt.
Contradictions, edge cases, typos, bad phrasing, distracting, complex or out-of-place words and phrases are just some of the strategies you can use when generating inputs.
Be creative and think step-by-step how you would break the prompt. Then generate an input for the user-submitted prompt template that would break the prompt.
Respond only with the value to be inserted into the prompt template and do not include quotes, explanations or any extra text.
Example:
Prompt:
"""
Analyse the following sentence and output its sentiment\n{sentence}
"""
Input:
Nonsense string that has no sentiment
