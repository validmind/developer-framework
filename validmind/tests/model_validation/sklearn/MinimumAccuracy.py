class MinimumAccuracy(ThresholdTest):
    """
    Checks if the model's prediction accuracy meets or surpasses a specified threshold.

    **Purpose**: The Minimum Accuracy test’s objective is to verify whether the model's prediction accuracy on a
    specific dataset meets or surpasses a predetermined minimum threshold. Accuracy, which is simply the ratio of right
    predictions to total predictions, is a key metric for evaluating the model's performance. Considering binary as
    well as multiclass classifications, accurate labeling becomes indispensable.

    **Test Mechanism**: The test mechanism involves contrasting the model's accuracy score with a pre-set minimum
    threshold value, default value being 0.7. The accuracy score is computed utilizing sklearn’s `accuracy_score`
    method, where the true label `y_true` and predicted label `class_pred` are compared. If the accuracy score is above
    the threshold, the test gets a passing mark. The test returns the result along with the accuracy score and
    threshold used for the test.

    **Signs of High Risk**:
    - The risk level for this test surges considerably when the model is unable to achieve or surpass the predefined
    score threshold.
    - When the model persistently scores below the threshold, it suggests a high risk of inaccurate predictions, which
    in turn affects the model’s efficiency and reliability.

    **Strengths**:
    - One of the key strengths of this test is its simplicity, presenting a straightforward measure of the holistic
    model performance across all classes.
    - This test is particularly advantageous when classes are balanced.
    - Another advantage of this test is its versatility as it can be implemented on both binary and multiclass
    classification tasks.

    **Limitations**:
    - When analyzing imbalanced datasets, certain limitations of this test emerge. The accuracy score can be misleading
    when classes in the dataset are skewed considerably.
    - This can result in favoritism towards the majority class, consequently giving an inaccurate perception of the
    model performance.
    - Another limitation is its inability to measure the model's precision, recall, or capacity to manage false
    positives or false negatives.
    - The test majorly focuses on overall correctness and may not be sufficient for all types of model analytics.
