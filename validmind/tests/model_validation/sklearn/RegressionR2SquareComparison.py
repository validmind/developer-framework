def RegressionR2SquareComparison(datasets, models):

    Compares R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values for different regression models across multiple datasets to assess
    model performance and relevance of features.

    ### Purpose

    The Regression R2 Square Comparison test aims to compare the R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values for different
    regression models across various datasets. It helps in assessing how well each model explains the variability in
    the dataset, and whether the models include irrelevant features.

    ### Test Mechanism

    This test operates by:

    - Iterating through each dataset-model pair.
    - Calculating the R-Squared values to measure how much of the variability in the dataset is explained by the model.
    - Calculating the Adjusted R-Squared values, which adjust the R-Squared based on the number of predictors in the
    model, making it more reliable when comparing models with different numbers of features.
    - Generating a summary table containing these values for each combination of dataset and model.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - If the R-Squared values are significantly low, it indicates the model isn't explaining much of the variability in
    the dataset.
    - A significant difference between R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values might indicate that the model includes
    irrelevant features.

    ### Strengths

    - Provides a quantitative measure of model performance in terms of variance explained.
    - Adjusted R-Squared accounts for the number of predictors, making it a more reliable measure when comparing models
    with different numbers of features.
    - Useful for time-series forecasting and regression tasks.

    ### Limitations

    - Assumes the dataset is provided as a DataFrameDataset object with `y`, `y_pred`, and `feature_columns` attributes.
    - Relies on `adj_r2_score` from the `statsmodels.statsutils` module, which needs to be correctly implemented and
    imported.
    - Requires that `dataset.y_pred(model)` returns the predicted values for the model.
