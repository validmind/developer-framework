@dataclass
class HomogeneityScore(ClusterPerformance):
    """
    Assesses clustering homogeneity by comparing true and predicted labels, scoring from 0 (heterogeneous) to 1
    (homogeneous).

    **Purpose**: The Homogeneity Score encapsulated in this performance test is used to measure the homogeneity of the
    clusters formed by a machine learning model. In simple terms, a clustering result satisfies homogeneity if all of
    its clusters contain only points which are members of a single class.

    **Test Mechanism**: This test uses the `homogeneity_score` function from the `sklearn.metrics` library to compare
    the ground truth class labels of the training and testing sets with the labels predicted by the given model. The
    returned score is a metric of the clustering accuracy, and ranges from 0.0 to 1.0, with 1.0 denoting the highest
    possible degree of homogeneity.

    **Signs of High Risk**:
    - A score close to 0: This denotes that clusters are highly heterogenous and points within the same cluster might
    not belong to the same class.
    - A significantly lower score for testing data compared to the score for training data: This can indicate
    overfitting, where the model has learned to perfectly match the training data but fails to perform well on unseen
    data.

    **Strengths**:
    - It provides a simple quantitative measure of the degree to which clusters contain points from only one class.
    - Useful for validating clustering solutions where the ground truth - class membership of points - is known.
    - It's agnostic to the absolute labels, and cares only that the points within the same cluster have the same class
    label.

    **Limitations**:
    - The Homogeneity Score is not useful for clustering solutions where the ground truth labels are not known.
    - It doesn’t work well with differently sized clusters since it gives predominance to larger clusters.
    - The score does not address the actual number of clusters formed, or the evenness of cluster sizes. It only checks
    the homogeneity within the given clusters created by the model.
