def ModelPredictionResiduals(

):
    """
    Assesses normality and behavior of residuals in regression models through visualization and statistical tests.

    ### Purpose

    The Model Prediction Residuals test aims to visualize the residuals of model predictions and assess their normality
    using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test. It helps to identify potential issues related to model assumptions and
    effectiveness.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The function calculates residuals and generates
    two figures: one for the time series of residuals and one for the histogram of residuals.
    It also calculates the KS test for normality and summarizes the results in a table.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - Residuals are not normally distributed, indicating potential issues with model assumptions.
    - High skewness or kurtosis in the residuals, which may suggest model misspecification.

    ### Strengths

    - Provides clear visualizations of residuals over time and their distribution.
    - Includes statistical tests to assess the normality of residuals.
    - Helps in identifying potential model misspecifications and assumption violations.

    ### Limitations

    - Assumes that the dataset is provided as a DataFrameDataset object with a .df attribute to access the pandas
    DataFrame.
    - Only generates plots for datasets with a datetime index, resulting in errors for other types of indices.
