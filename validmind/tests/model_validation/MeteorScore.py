def MeteorScore(dataset, model):
    """
    Assesses the quality of machine-generated translations by comparing them to human-produced references using the
    METEOR score, which evaluates precision, recall, and word order.

    ### Purpose

    The METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) score is designed to evaluate the quality
    of machine translations by comparing them against reference translations. It emphasizes both the accuracy and
    fluency of translations, incorporating precision, recall, and word order into its assessment.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The function starts by extracting the true and predicted values from the provided dataset and model. The METEOR
    score is computed for each pair of machine-generated translation (prediction) and its corresponding human-produced
    reference. This is done by considering unigram matches between the translations, including matches based on surface
    forms, stemmed forms, and synonyms. The score is a combination of unigram precision and recall, adjusted for word
    order through a fragmentation penalty. Scores are compiled into a dataframe, and histograms and bar charts are
    generated to visualize the distribution of METEOR scores. Additionally, a table of descriptive statistics (mean,
    median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) is compiled for the METEOR scores, providing a comprehensive
    summary of the model's performance.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - Lower METEOR scores can indicate a lack of alignment between the machine-generated translations and their
    human-produced references, highlighting potential deficiencies in both the accuracy and fluency of translations.
    - Significant discrepancies in word order or an excessive fragmentation penalty could signal issues with how the
    translation model processes and reconstructs sentence structures, potentially compromising the natural flow of
    translated text.
    - Persistent underperformance across a variety of text types or linguistic contexts might suggest a broader
    inability of the model to adapt to the nuances of different languages or dialects, pointing towards gaps in its
    training or inherent limitations.

    ### Strengths

    - Incorporates a balanced consideration of precision and recall, weighted towards recall to reflect the importance
    of content coverage in translations.
    - Directly accounts for word order, offering a nuanced evaluation of translation fluency beyond simple lexical
    matching.
    - Adapts to various forms of lexical similarity, including synonyms and stemmed forms, allowing for flexible
    matching.

    ### Limitations

    - While comprehensive, the complexity of METEOR's calculation can make it computationally intensive, especially for
    large datasets.
    - The use of external resources for synonym and stemming matching may introduce variability based on the resources'
    quality and relevance to the specific translation task.
