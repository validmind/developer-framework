def ModelMetadata(model):
    """
    Compare metadata of different models and generate a summary table with the results.

    **Purpose**: The purpose of this function is to compare the metadata of different models, including information about their architecture, framework, framework version, and programming language.

    **Test Mechanism**: The function retrieves the metadata for each model using `get_model_info`, renames columns according to a predefined set of labels, and compiles this information into a summary table.

    **Signs of High Risk**:
    - Inconsistent or missing metadata across models can indicate potential issues in model documentation or management.
    - Significant differences in framework versions or programming languages might pose challenges in model integration and deployment.

    **Strengths**:
    - Provides a clear comparison of essential model metadata.
    - Standardizes metadata labels for easier interpretation and comparison.
    - Helps identify potential compatibility or consistency issues across models.

    **Limitations**:
    - Assumes that the `get_model_info` function returns all necessary metadata fields.
    - Relies on the correctness and completeness of the metadata provided by each model.
    - Does not include detailed parameter information, focusing instead on high-level metadata.
