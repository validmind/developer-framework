class JarqueBera(Metric):
    """
    Assesses normality of dataset features in an ML model using the Jarque-Bera test.

    ### Purpose

    The purpose of the Jarque-Bera test as implemented in this metric is to determine if the features in the dataset of
    a given Machine Learning model follow a normal distribution. This is crucial for understanding the distribution and
    behavior of the model's features, as numerous statistical methods assume normal distribution of the data.

    ### Test Mechanism

    The test mechanism involves computing the Jarque-Bera statistic, p-value, skew, and kurtosis for each feature in
    the dataset. It utilizes the 'jarque_bera' function from the 'statsmodels' library in Python, storing the results
    in a dictionary. The test evaluates the skewness and kurtosis to ascertain whether the dataset follows a normal
    distribution. A significant p-value (typically less than 0.05) implies that the data does not possess normal
    distribution.

    ### Signs of High Risk

    - A high Jarque-Bera statistic and a low p-value (usually less than 0.05) indicate high-risk conditions.
    - Such results suggest the data significantly deviates from a normal distribution. If a machine learning model
    expects feature data to be normally distributed, these findings imply that it may not function as intended.

    ### Strengths

    - Provides insights into the shape of the data distribution, helping determine whether a given set of data follows
    a normal distribution.
    - Particularly useful for risk assessment for models that assume a normal distribution of data.
    - By measuring skewness and kurtosis, it provides additional insights into the nature and magnitude of a
    distribution's deviation.

    ### Limitations

    - Only checks for normality in the data distribution. It cannot provide insights into other types of distributions.
    - Datasets that aren't normally distributed but follow some other distribution might lead to inaccurate risk
    assessments.
    - Highly sensitive to large sample sizes, often rejecting the null hypothesis (that data is normally distributed)
    even for minor deviations in larger datasets.
