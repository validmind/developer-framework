@dataclass
class ResidualsVisualInspection(Metric):
    """
    Provides a comprehensive visual analysis of residuals for regression models utilizing various plot types.

    **Purpose**: The main purpose of this metric is to visualize and analyze the residuals (the differences between the
    observed and predicted values) of a regression problem. It allows for a graphical exploration of the model's
    errors, helping to identify statistical patterns or anomalies that may indicate a systematic bias in the model's
    predictions. By inspecting the residuals, we can check how well the model fits the data and meets the assumptions
    of the model.

    **Test Mechanism**: The metric generates four common types of residual plots which are: a histogram with kernel
    density estimation, a quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot, a residuals series dot plot, and an autocorrelation function
    (ACF) plot.

    - The residuals histogram with kernel density estimation visualizes the distribution of residuals and allows to
    check if they are normally distributed.
    - Q-Q plot compares the observed quantiles of the data to the quantiles of a standard normal distribution, helping
    to assess the normality of residuals.
    - A residuals dot plot indicates the variation in residuals over time, which helps in identifying any time-related
    pattern in residuals.
    - ACF plot visualizes the correlation of an observation with its previous observations, helping to pinpoint any
    seasonality effect within residuals.

    **Signs of High Risk**:

    - Skewness or asymmetry in the histogram or a significant deviation from the straight line in the Q-Q plot, which
    indicates that the residuals aren't normally distributed.
    - Large spikes in the ACF plot, indicating that the residuals are correlated, in violation of the assumption that
    they are independent.
    - Non-random patterns in the dot plot of residuals, indicating potential model misspecification.

    **Strengths**:

    - Visual analysis of residuals is a powerful yet simple way to understand a model’s behavior across the data set
    and to identify problems with the model's assumptions or its fit to the data.
    - The test is applicable to any regression model, irrespective of complexity.
    - By exploring residuals, we might uncover relationships that were not captured by the model, revealing
    opportunities for model improvement.

    **Limitations**:

    - Visual tests are largely subjective and can be open to interpretation. Clear-cut decisions about the model based
    solely on these plots may not be possible.
    - The metrics from the test do not directly infer the action based on the results; domain-specific knowledge and
    expert judgement is often required to interpret the results.
    - These plots can indicate a problem with the model but they do not necessarily reveal the nature or cause of the
    problem.
    - The test assumes that the error terms are identically distributed, which might not always be the case in
    real-world scenarios.
