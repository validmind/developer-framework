    "# Prompt validation for large language models (LLMs)\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook guides model developers through using ValidMind for running and documenting prompt validation tests for a large language model (LLM) specialized in sentiment analysis for financial news. It shows you how to set up the ValidMind Developer Framework, initialize the client library, and use a specific prompt template for analyzing the sentiment of given sentences. The prompt validation covers the initialization of a test dataset and the creation of a foundational model using ValidMind's framework, followed by the execution of a test suite specifically designed for prompt validation. The notebook also includes example data to test the model's ability to correctly identify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral.\n"

As a model developer, you use the ValidMind Developer Framework to automate documentation and validation tests, and then use the ValidMind AI Risk Platform UI to collaborate on model documentation. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model validators.\n",
