We will see how we can initialize an embedding model, a retrieval model and a generator model with LangChain components and use them within the ValidMind developer framework to run tests against them. Finally, we will see how we can put them together in a Pipeline and run that to get e2e results and run tests against that."

    "\n",
    "ValidMind is a platform for managing model risk, including risk associated with AI and statistical models.\n",
    "\n",
    "You use the ValidMind Developer Framework to automate documentation and validation tests, and then use the ValidMind AI Risk Platform UI to collaborate on model documentation. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model validators.\n",

    "### Before you begin\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have basic familiarity with Python, including an understanding of how functions work. If you are new to Python, you can still run the notebook but we recommend further familiarizing yourself with the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter errors due to missing modules in your Python environment, install the modules with `pip install`, and then re-run the notebook. For more help, refer to [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).\n",

    "If you haven't already seen our [Get started with the ValidMind Developer Framework](https://docs.validmind.ai/developer/get-started-developer-framework.html), we recommend you explore the available resources for developers at some point. There, you can learn more about documenting models, find code samples, or read our developer reference.\n",

    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **FunctionModels**: ValidMind offers support for creating `VMModel` instances from Python functions. This enables us to support any \"model\" by simply using the provided function as the model's `predict` method.\n",
    "- **PipelineModels**: ValidMind models (`VMModel` instances) of any type can be piped together to create a model pipeline. This allows model components to be created and tested/documented independently, and then combined into a single model for end-to-end testing and documentation. We use the `|` operator to pipe models together.\n",
    "- **RAG**: RAG stands for Retrieval Augmented Generation and refers to a wide range of GenAI applications where some form of retrieval is used to add context to the prompt so that the LLM that generates content can refer to it when creating its output. In this notebook, we are going to implement a simple RAG setup using LangChain components.\n"
