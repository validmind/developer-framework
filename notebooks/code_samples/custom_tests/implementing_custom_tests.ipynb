    "# Implement custom tests\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom tests or metrics extend the functionality of ValidMind, allowing you to document any model or use case with added flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "ValidMind provides a comprehensive set of metrics out-of-the-box to evaluate and document your models and datasets. We recognize there will be cases where the default metrics do not support a model or dataset, or specific documentation is needed. In these cases, you can create and use your own custom code to accomplish what you need. To streamline custom code integration, we support the creation of custom metric functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This interactive notebook provides a step-by-step guide for implementing and registering custom metrics with ValidMind, running them individually, viewing the results on the ValidMind platform, and incorporating them into your model documentation template.\n"

    "#### Prerequisites\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that you are familiar with Python and have a basic understanding of defining functions and using decorators. If you are new to these concepts, we recommend that you familiarize yourself with them before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Documentation Templates**: Documentation templates are used to define the structure of your model documentation. They specify the tests that should be run, and how the results should be displayed. In the context of this tutorial, you will not need to know how templates work, merely how to add custom metrics to them via the ValidMind Platform.\n",
    "- **Tests**: Tests are the building blocks of ValidMind. They are used to evaluate and document models and datasets. Tests can be run individually or as part of a suite that is defined by your model documentation template.\n",
    "- **Metrics**: Metrics are a subset of tests that do not have thresholds. In the context of this notebook, you can think of metrics and tests as interchangeable concepts.\n",
    "- **Custom Metrics**: Custom metrics are functions that you define to evaluate your model or dataset. These functions can be registered with ValidMind to be used in the platform.\n",
    "- **Inputs**: In the ValidMind framework, inputs are objects to be evaluated and documented. They can be any of the following:\n",
    "    - **model**: A single model that has been initialized in ValidMind with `vm.init_model()`. See the [Model Documentation](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_model) or the for more information.\n",
    "    - **dataset**: Single dataset that has been initialized in ValidMind with `vm.init_dataset()`. See the [Dataset Documentation](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_dataset) for more information.\n",
    "    - **models**: A list of ValidMind models - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple models in your custom metric.\n",
    "    - **datasets**: A list of ValidMind datasets - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple datasets in your custom metric. See this [example](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/how_to/run_tests_that_require_multiple_datasets.html) for more information.\n",
    "- **Parameters**: Parameters are additional arguments that can be passed when running a ValidMind test. These can be used to pass additional information to a metric, customize its behavior, or provide additional context.\n",
    "- **Outputs**: Custom metrics can return any number of the following elements (in any order):\n",
    "    - **table**: Either a list of dictionaries where each dictionary represents a row in the table, or a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "    - **plot**: A matplotlib or plotly figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Custom metric overview\n",
    "\n",
    "A custom metric is any function that takes as arguments a set of inputs and optionally some parameters and returns one or more outputs. That's it! The function can be as simple or as complex as you need it to be. It can use external libraries, make API calls, or do anything else that you can do in Python. The only requirement is that the function signature and return values can be \"understood\" and handled by the ValidMind developer framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you are familiar with what custom metrics are and the key concepts involved in creating and using them, let's dive into some hands-on examples!"

We have shown how to define custom metric functions, register them with the ValidMind framework, run them against models and datasets, and add them to model documentation templates. We have also shown how to return tables and plots from custom metrics and how to use them in the ValidMind platform. We hope this tutorial has been helpful in understanding how to create and use custom metrics in ValidMind."
