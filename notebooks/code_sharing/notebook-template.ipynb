        "This notebook guides you through using ValidMind for running and documenting prompt validation tests for a large language model (LLM) specialized in sentiment analysis for financial news. It shows you how to set up the ValidMind Developer Framework, initializes the client library, and uses a specific prompt template for analyzing the sentiment of given sentences. The prompt validation covers the initialization of a test dataset and the creation of a foundational model using ValidMind's framework, followed by the execution of a test suite specifically designed for prompt validation. The notebook also includes example data to test the model's ability to correctly identify sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral."
