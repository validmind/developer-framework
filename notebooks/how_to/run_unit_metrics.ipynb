    "In this notebook, we introduce the concept of *Unit Metric* and provide a step-by-step guide on how to define, execute and extract results from these measures. As an example, we use data from a customer churn use case to fit a binary classification model. To illustrate the application of these measures, we show how to run sklearn classification metrics as unit metrics, demonstrating their utility in quantifying model performance and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Model Risk Management (MRM), the primary objective is to identify, assess, and mitigate the risks associated with the development, implementation, and ongoing use of quantitative models. The process of measuring risk involves the understanding and assessment of evidence generated throw multiple tests across all the model development lifecycle stages, from data collection and data quality to model performance and explainability. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evidence vs Risk\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between evidence and quantifiable risk measures is a critical aspect of MRM. Evidence, in this context, refers to the outputs from various tests conducted throughout the model lifecycle. For instance, a table displaying the number of missing values per feature in a dataset is a form of evidence. It shows where data might be incomplete, which can affect the model's performance and reliability. Similarly, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is evidence of the model's classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these pieces of evidence do not offer a direct measure of risk. To quantify risk, one must derive metrics from this evidence that reflect the potential impact on the model's performance and the decisions it informs. For example, the missing data rate, calculated as the percentage of missing values in the dataset, is a quantifiable risk measure that indicates the risk associated with data quality. Similarly, the accuracy score, which measures the proportion of correctly classified labels, acts as an indicator of performance risk in a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unit Metric\n",
    "\n",
    "A *Unit Metric* is a single value measure that is used to identify and monitor risks arising from the development of Machine Learning or AI models. This metric simplifies evidence into a single actionable number, that can be monitored and compared over time or across different models or datasets. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Properties**\n",
    "- They are the fundamental computation unit that returns a single value.\n",
    "- They quantify risk and can be used to monitor and assess risks associated with a model's entire lifecycle.\n",
    "- Measurable, relevant, and linked to risk areas and critical business processes - e.g., regulatory requirements, risk appetite, model performance, data quality.\n",
    "- Standalone in nature, meaning they do not rely on other metrics for their calculation or interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating Unit Metrics into your ML workflow streamlines risk assessment, turning complex analyses into clear, actionable insights."
