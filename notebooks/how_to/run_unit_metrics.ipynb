    "To turn complex evidence into actionable insights, you can run a unit metric as a single-value measure to quantify and monitor risks throughout a model's lifecycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this interactive notebook, we introduce the concept of _unit metric_ and provide a step-by-step guide on how to define, execute and extract results from these measures. As an example, we use data from a customer churn use case to fit a binary classification model. To illustrate the application of these measures, we show you how to run sklearn classification metrics as unit metrics, demonstrating their utility in quantifying model performance and risk.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Model Risk Management (MRM), the primary objective is to identify, assess, and mitigate the risks associated with the development, implementation, and ongoing use of quantitative models. The process of measuring risk involves the understanding and assessment of evidence generated throw multiple tests across all the model development lifecycle stages, from data collection and data quality to model performance and explainability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Evidence versus risk**\n",
    "\n",
    "The distinction between evidence and quantifiable risk measures is a critical aspect of MRM. Evidence, in this context, refers to the outputs from various tests conducted throughout the model lifecycle. For instance, a table displaying the number of missing values per feature in a dataset is a form of evidence. It shows where data might be incomplete, which can affect the model's performance and reliability. Similarly, a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is a graphical plot that illustrates the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier system as its discrimination threshold is varied. The curve is evidence of the model's classification performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these pieces of evidence do not offer a direct measure of risk. To quantify risk, one must derive metrics from this evidence that reflect the potential impact on the model's performance and the decisions it informs. For example, the missing data rate, calculated as the percentage of missing values in the dataset, is a quantifiable risk measure that indicates the risk associated with data quality. Similarly, the accuracy score, which measures the proportion of correctly classified labels, acts as an indicator of performance risk in a classification model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Unit metric**\n",
    "\n",
    "A _Unit metric_ is a single value measure that is used to identify and monitor risks arising from the development of Machine Learning or AI models. This metric simplifies evidence into a single actionable number, that can be monitored and compared over time or across different models or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are the fundamental computation unit that returns a single value.\n",
    "- They quantify risk and can be used to monitor and assess risks associated with a model's entire lifecycle.\n",
    "- Measurable, relevant, and linked to risk areas and critical business processes - e.g., regulatory requirements, risk appetite, model performance, data quality.\n",
    "- Standalone in nature, meaning they do not rely on other metrics for their calculation or interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incorporating unit metrics into your ML workflow streamlines risk assessment, turning complex analyses into clear, actionable insights.\n"

    "\n",
    "ValidMind is a platform for managing model risk, including risk associated with AI and statistical models.\n\nYou use the ValidMind Developer Framework to automate documentation and validation tests, and then use the ValidMind AI Risk Platform UI to collaborate on model documentation. Together, these products simplify model risk management, facilitate compliance with regulations and institutional standards, and enhance collaboration between yourself and model validators.\n",

    "\n",
    "This notebook assumes you have basic familiarity with Python, including an understanding of how functions work. If you are new to Python, you can still run the notebook but we recommend further familiarizing yourself with the language. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you encounter errors due to missing modules in your Python environment, install the modules with `pip install`, and then re-run the notebook. For more help, refer to [Installing Python Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/installing/index.html).\n",

    "### Key concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model documentation**: A structured and detailed record pertaining to a model, encompassing key components such as its underlying assumptions, methodologies, data sources, inputs, performance metrics, evaluations, limitations, and intended uses. It serves to ensure transparency, adherence to regulatory requirements, and a clear understanding of potential risks associated with the model’s application.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Documentation template**: Functions as a test suite and lays out the structure of model documentation, segmented into various sections and sub-sections. Documentation templates define the structure of your model documentation, specifying the tests that should be run, and how the results should be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tests**: A function contained in the ValidMind Developer Framework, designed to run a specific quantitative test on the dataset or model. Tests are the building blocks of ValidMind, used to evaluate and document models and datasets, and can be run individually or as part of a suite defined by your model documentation template.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Metrics**: A subset of tests that do not have thresholds. In the context of this notebook, metrics and tests can be thought of as interchangeable concepts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Custom metrics**: Custom metrics are functions that you define to evaluate your model or dataset. These functions can be registered with ValidMind to be used in the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inputs**: Objects to be evaluated and documented in the ValidMind framework. They can be any of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - **model**: A single model that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_model()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_model).\n",
    "  - **dataset**: Single dataset that has been initialized in ValidMind with [`vm.init_dataset()`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind.html#init_dataset).\n",
    "  - **models**: A list of ValidMind models - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple models in your custom metric.\n",
    "  - **datasets**: A list of ValidMind datasets - usually this is used when you want to compare multiple datasets in your custom metric. See this [example](https://docs.validmind.ai/notebooks/how_to/run_tests_that_require_multiple_datasets.html) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters**: Additional arguments that can be passed when running a ValidMind test, used to pass additional information to a metric, customize its behavior, or provide additional context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outputs**: Custom metrics can return elements like tables or plots. Tables may be a list of dictionaries (each representing a row) or a pandas DataFrame. Plots may be matplotlib or plotly figures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Test suites**: Collections of tests designed to run together to automate and generate model documentation end-to-end for specific use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example: the [`classifier_full_suite`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html#ClassifierFullSuite) test suite runs tests from the [`tabular_dataset`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/tabular_datasets.html) and [`classifier`](https://docs.validmind.ai/validmind/validmind/test_suites/classifier.html) test suites to fully document the data and model sections for binary classification model use-cases.\n"

    "Up until now we have just been running individual unit metrics on their own. However, in a normal use-case, you will likely want to compose multiple unit metrics into a more complex metric. For instance, we may want to compose the above metrics (`f1_score`, `precision`, `recall`, `accuracy` and `roc_auc`) into a single tabular display showing the overall model performance. This can be done by using the `run_test` function. This will allow us to run all these metrics at the same time, display the results in a single output, customize the output using html templates, and finally save the result as a single composite metric to the ValidMind platform. Let's see how we can do this."
