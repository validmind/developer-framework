    "\n",
    "- **Task Types**: Represent the kind of modeling task associated with a test. For instance:\n",
    "  - **classification:** Works with Classification Models and Datasets\n",
    "  - **regression:** Works with Regression Models and Datasets\n",
    "  - **text classification:** Works with Text Classification Models and Datasets\n",
    "  - **text summarization:** Works with Text Summarization Models and Datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tags**: Free-form descriptors providing more details about the test, what data and models the test is compatible with and what category the test falls into etc. Some examples include:\n",
    "  - **llm:** Tests that work with Large Language Models\n",
    "  - **nlp:** Tests relevant for natural language processing.\n",
    "  - **binary_classification:** Tests for binary classification tasks.\n",
    "  - **forecasting:** Tests for forecasting and time-series analysis.\n",
    "  - **tabular_data:** Tests for tabular data like CSVs and Excel spreadsheets."
